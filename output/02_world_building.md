### 1. WORLD OVERVIEW

**San Hastina** is a sprawling, neon-lit metropolis that embodies both the vibrancy of modern life and the underbelly of crime. Towering skyscrapers, mainly owned by the omnipotent **Kuru Corporation**, dominate the skyline, their glass façades reflecting the chaotic, colorful nightlife below. The city is divided into five boroughs, each possessing its unique character, culture, and crime syndicate. 

- **The Downtown District** is a hub of corporate power, filled with high-end boutiques, luxury hotels, and corporate offices where deals are struck behind closed doors. Here, the Kuru Corporation orchestrates its influence over the city, using both legitimate and illegitimate means.
  
- **The Gully** is the gritty underbelly of San Hastina, a labyrinth of alleys filled with fight clubs, drug dens, and illegal gambling houses. The air is thick with the scent of sweat and desperation, where the rules of the street dictate survival.

- **The Heights** is a neighborhood of opulent penthouses and exclusive nightclubs, where the wealthy indulge in excess while oblivious to the struggles below. Here, art and music thrive, but every artist has a price to pay.

- **The Docks** are a chaotic blend of shipping containers and warehouses, serving as the main entry point for smuggled goods and contraband. The sound of container cranes and the salty sea air create an atmosphere of both opportunity and danger.

- **The Suburbs** provide a stark contrast, where families live in manicured homes, oblivious to the city's darker dealings. However, even here, corruption seeps in, as local law enforcement turns a blind eye to the criminal activities that encroach upon their lives.

San Hastina's atmosphere is charged with tension. The constant hum of traffic, the distant wail of sirens, and the vibrant nightlife create a rhythm that pulses through the city. Social media feeds buzz with the latest rumors and scandals, while CCTV cameras keep an ever-watchful eye, creating a sense of paranoia and surveillance.

### 2. POWER STRUCTURE

San Hastina is ruled by a complex web of power dynamics, with the Kuru Corporation at the apex. The corporation uses its financial muscle to control key political figures, ensuring that laws favor corporate interests. Below them are the five major crime families, each vying for control over their respective boroughs:

- **The Kauravas**: The most powerful family, led by **Duryodhana**, who uses ruthless tactics to expand their influence and eliminate rivals. They run the Downtown District and have deep ties to corporate elites.

- **The Pandavas**: Once the rightful rulers of the city, they are led by **Yudhishthira**, who seeks to reclaim their lost power. The Pandavas are seen as the champions of the downtrodden, but their quest for justice often leads them into morally grey areas.

- **The Vyasas**: A cunning group known for their manipulation and intelligence-gathering, they control the Gully and its underground enterprises. Their leader, **Shakuni**, is a master of deception and plots.

- **The Bhimas**: A family of enforcers known for their brute strength, they operate in the Docks, running smuggling operations and underground fights. Their loyalty is fierce, but their thirst for revenge can lead to violent outbursts.

- **The Draupadis**: A powerful and influential faction of women who run the Heights, focusing on arts and nightlife. Their leader, **Draupadi**, is a symbol of resilience and justice, using her platform to challenge the status quo.

Power is gained through territory, loyalty, and manipulation. Betrayal is met with brutal punishment, while alliances shift like the winds of fortune. The police, often on the payroll of the Kauravas, are more interested in maintaining the status quo than delivering justice.

### 3. SOCIAL RULES

San Hastina's society is built on a precarious balance of loyalty, fear, and ambition. The rules are unwritten yet universally understood:

- **Loyalty is paramount**: Betrayal is not only frowned upon but punished severely, often with death. Trust is rare, and every character carries a weapon and a secret.

- **Justice is a personal affair**: The police are corrupt and can be bought, leading citizens to take justice into their own hands. Vigilante justice is common, and the line between right and wrong is blurred.

- **Social media shapes perceptions**: Information spreads rapidly, and public opinion can shift overnight. A scandal can ruin a career, while a well-timed tweet can elevate a nobody to fame.

- **Honor among thieves**: There exists a code of conduct among the crime families. While they may be ruthless, they respect certain boundaries, such as not harming family members or innocent bystanders.

### 4. TECHNOLOGY & TOOLS

San Hastina thrives on modern technology, which shapes both conflict and communication:

- **Smartphones and social media**: These are the lifelines of the city, allowing for instant communication and information sharing. They facilitate everything from organizing underground races to spreading rumors that can topple empires.

- **CCTV and surveillance**: High-tech cameras are ubiquitous, creating a panopticon effect. Every move is watched, which leads to paranoia and strategic planning among criminals.

- **Weapons**: Characters carry an array of firearms, knives, and improvised weapons, each reflecting their personality. Signature weapons symbolize their identities and values.

- **Vehicles**: Custom cars are status symbols and tools for heists. Every major character has a signature vehicle that represents their style and power.
